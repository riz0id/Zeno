# Zeno

This repository is named Zeno because he did not understand convergence or series and neither do I. Here you'll find a lot of the necessary proofs for real numbers missing from the standard library that I was too lazy to actuallly commit to the stdlib.

Theres still a lot to be done including contributing fundamental proofs about rational to the stdlib since that's a much better home for them.

agda is terrible don't use it.
